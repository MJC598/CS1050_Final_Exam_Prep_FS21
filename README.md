# CS1050_Final_Exam_Prep_FS21

### Getting Started
This is a repository for code examples and preparation for Mizzou CS1050 Fall 2021 final exam.

To download this repository log into the server the way you have for each lab and type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MJC598/CS1050_Final_Exam_Prep_FS21.git
```
This will download the repository onto your user in the server similar to how lab 11 and 13 worked with csstart1050 
commands.

Next just navigate to the code you want to access using the `cd` and `ls` commands. If you decide to do this outside of 
the server it is expected you know how to work your independent system.

### First Practice Lab
Folders [SolutionCode](SolutionCode) and [StarterCode](StarterCode) contain the first practice lab. 
Each folder contains identical copies of the lab with the solution being completed and the starter being just a 
framework for starting the lab. This is the practice lab discussed in the review session that emphasizes
**malloc, string manipulation, and pass-by-reference**.
